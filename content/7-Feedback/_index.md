### General Evaluation

**1. Working environment**  
The working environment at AWS is very professional yet still friendly and open. Everyone is always willing to support me when I face difficulties and explain things when I don’t fully understand, so I feel quite comfortable asking questions and discussing issues. The atmosphere is serious but not too stressful, which helps me stay focused and feel more confident when participating in real projects.

**2. Support from mentor / team admin**  
The mentors in the team are very supportive, from explaining AWS-related knowledge to guiding how to work in a professional technical team. When I run into problems, they don’t just give me the answers, but also show me how to think about the problem so that I can find solutions on my own. Thanks to that, I’ve become more proactive and learned a lot of practical experience.

**3. Alignment between work and my major**  
I am studying Software Engineering, and my internship work is joining the clickstream project with the team and integrating AWS services into the system, so I find it very aligned with my major. The work allows me to apply my fundamental knowledge in programming, systems, and software architecture, and at the same time gives me the chance to work with a real cloud environment. This helps me both reinforce what I learned at school and better understand which career direction I want to pursue in the future.

**4. Learning opportunities & skill development**  
During the internship, I’ve had many opportunities to improve both my technical knowledge and how to participate in a real project. Besides that, I’ve also developed my teamwork skills and communication skills in a professional environment, and learned how to receive and give feedback in a more positive and constructive way.

**5. Culture & team spirit**  
The working culture at AWS is very positive: people respect each other and are willing to share and support whenever needed. Within the team, everyone collaborates smoothly, discusses together when there are technical issues, and works towards the common goals of the project. This makes me, even as an intern, feel trusted and truly part of the team.

**6. Policies / benefits for interns**  
In addition to the real working environment and practical tasks, I also had the opportunity to join around 4–5 events organized by AWS, where they shared more about technology, knowledge, and topics related to the industry. These activities are very valuable, helping me broaden my perspective, stay updated with new trends, and connect with many professionals in the field. This makes the internship experience even richer and more meaningful.

If possible, I just hope the company will continue to maintain these sessions regularly so that everyone has more opportunities to connect and learn from each other.

- Do you want to continue with this program in the future?  
  - **Yes.** If I have the chance, I would really like to keep joining other projects or programs at the company to continue learning, improving my skills, and building a longer-term connection.

- Other comments (free sharing):  
  - I don’t have any additional comments; I mainly want to say **thank you** to the company and all the team members for always supporting, encouraging, and creating good conditions for me throughout the internship. This has been a meaningful experience that helped me grow, both in terms of technical skills and working attitude.
