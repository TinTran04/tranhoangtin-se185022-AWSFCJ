### Week 2 Achievements:

* Created and managed EC2 instances (launch, stop/delete, view details).
* Understood how to configure and use AWS S3 to store and manage objects (upload, view, delete, set permissions).
* Created and tested a simple AWS Lambda function, and learned how to trigger Lambda from other services.
* Successfully deployed a sample application using AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
* Gained a basic understanding of AWS IAM, including how to:
  * Create IAM Users, Groups, and Roles.
  * Attach IAM Policies to control access following the “least privilege” principle.
* Completed several combined hands-on labs for EC2, S3, Lambda, and Elastic Beanstalk, reinforcing the theoretical knowledge learned.
