### Week 6 Objectives:

* Learn about **AWS Auto Scaling** and **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)** to ensure the application can scale and distribute traffic efficiently.
* Study **AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS)** and **AWS Fargate**.
* Practice deploying a containerized application on ECS and using Auto Scaling to automatically adjust resources.

### Tasks to be carried out this week:

### Week 6 Achievements:

* Configured **AWS Auto Scaling** and **Elastic Load Balancing** for applications running on EC2 / ECS.
* Became familiar with **AWS ECS** and **AWS Fargate**, and understood how **Cluster – Task – Service** are organized.
* Practiced **deploying a containerized application on ECS**, using Fargate to run containers without managing servers.
* Understood how to combine **ELB + Auto Scaling + ECS** to build a system that can automatically scale, distribute traffic, and operate stably.
