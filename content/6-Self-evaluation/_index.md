During my internship at **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** from **08/09/2025** to **05/12/2025**, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply the knowledge I acquired at university in a real working environment.  

I participated in the **Batch-based Clickstream Analytics Platform** project for an e-commerce website selling computer products, with the main responsibilities as follows:

- Researching and working with AWS services such as **Amazon S3, AWS Lambda, Amazon EventBridge, Amazon EC2, AWS Amplify, Amazon Cognito** to support the collection and processing of clickstream data.  
- Supporting the construction of a **batch-based pipeline for collecting, storing, and processing clickstream data**, in which user behaviour data on the website is captured, written to S3, and processed periodically by Lambda/EventBridge before being loaded into the analytics system.  
- Taking part in **configuring the infrastructure on AWS**, connecting to **PostgreSQL/Supabase** and integrating with the **frontend application (Next.js)** of the e-commerce website.  
- Writing **technical documentation and progress reports**, and communicating regularly with my mentor and team to update status and align on implementation directions.  

Through this, I have clearly improved my skills in **programming, system design, working with cloud services, building batch data pipelines, technical writing, teamwork, and communication in a professional environment**.  

In terms of work attitude, I always tried to complete the tasks assigned, followed the team’s working processes, and proactively communicated when facing difficulties to ensure the quality of my work.

To objectively reflect my internship, I would like to provide the following self-evaluation based on several criteria:

### Areas for Improvement

- Strengthen my **discipline** and **time management skills**, strictly following rules and deadlines in any working environment.  
- Further develop my **problem-solving mindset**, especially in analyzing root causes and comparing multiple options before choosing a solution.  
- Improve my **communication skills**: present more concisely and clearly in meetings, and proactively share difficulties/questions with my mentor and team members.  

Overall, I consider this internship at AWS a very meaningful experience that helped me grow both in **technical capability** and **work attitude**, and also made me more aware of the areas I need to continue improving in the future.
