### Key Content

#### Paradigm shift: From Generative AI to Agentic AI

- **Generative AI**  
  - Focuses on **generating content** (text, images, source code, etc.) based on user **prompts**.  
  - Fundamentally **reactive**: only responds when queried.  

- **Agentic AI (AI agents)**  
  - Focuses on **autonomy and the ability to act**.  
  - Can **perceive its environment**, plan, reason through multiple steps, and **execute tasks automatically** without constant human intervention.  
  - The goal is to build systems where **“AI does the work for us”**, not just “chats with us”.  

The workshop helped me clearly understand that Agentic AI is the evolution from *“AI that answers”* to *“AI that acts”*, which is very suitable for complex and repetitive tasks in enterprises.

#### Introduction to Amazon QuickSuite

- **First live demo in Vietnam:**  
  - The workshop marked the **first live demonstration** of Amazon QuickSuite for users in Vietnam.  

- **Unified ecosystem:**  
  - Tightly integrates:  
    - **Amazon QuickSight** – data visualization and analytics.  
    - **QuickSuite Q** – natural language interaction for asking questions and generating insights.  
  - Together, they enable **“Analyst Agents”** that can read data, answer business questions, and propose actions.  

- **Speed and agility (“Quick”):**  
  - Allows businesses to move from **idea → prototype → real-world testing** in a short time.  
  - Suitable for teams that want to experiment quickly and iterate continuously.  

- **Data-centric by design:**  
  - QuickSuite is built for **large data volumes**, ensuring that AI agents have enough “fuel” to make accurate decisions grounded in real business context.  

#### Partner ecosystem & strategic support

- **AWS** provides the underlying infrastructure platform and AI/Analytics services.  
- **Cloud Kinetics** plays the role of:  
  - Architecture advisor, ensuring that solutions fit the specific needs of each business.  
  - Supporting the **“last mile”** of implementation – turning abstract technology into concrete solutions that run in production.  

This **“two-layer support model”** (AWS + partner) helps businesses reduce risk, especially when starting out with new technologies such as Agentic AI.

#### AWS LIFT program – Financial support for innovation

- **Credits of up to USD 80,000** for eligible customers, particularly new customers and SMBs.  
- Purpose:  
  - Lower the cost barrier when experimenting with high-performance compute systems and AI-related R&D projects.  
  - Allow companies to focus on **ideas and execution**, instead of worrying too much about initial infrastructure costs.

### What I Learned

#### Design Mindset

- **Focus on system autonomy:**  
  - When designing Agentic AI, the goal is to build agents that **proactively work on behalf of humans**, for example:  
    - Automatically generating periodic reports.  
    - Monitoring metrics and sending alerts.  
    - Suggesting operational adjustments (such as in the supply chain).  

- **Tying AI to concrete operational bottlenecks:**  
  - AI should not be built just because it is a “trend”, but should start from processes that are:  
    - Repetitive.  
    - Composed of many manual steps.  
    - Error-prone when done entirely by humans.  

#### Technical Architecture

- **Ecosystem-based approach:**  
  - An effective agent must be connected to **multiple tools**: data sources, BI, APIs, workflows, etc.  
  - In this context, **QuickSuite** is the “connective tissue” between:  
    - Data (data sources, QuickSight).  
    - Action logic (questions, rules, automated task workflows).  

- **AWS infrastructure readiness:**  
  - The first step is to set up the **AWS account, region, access permissions**, and required services.  
  - This lays the foundation to easily enable/disable and experiment with new services such as QuickSuite and Agentic workflows later on.  

#### Modernization & Deployment Strategy

- **Early adopter advantage:**  
  - Businesses/teams that learn and master QuickSuite early will gain advantages in **productivity, decision-making speed, and the ability to test new business models**.  

- **Smart cost management:**  
  - Combining **AWS LIFT credits** with a small, clearly scoped PoC approach.  
  - Helps **accelerate time-to-market** while still minimizing financial risk.

### Application to My Work

- **Deepening my knowledge of QuickSuite:**  
  - Exploring how to integrate **QuickSight + QuickSuite Q** into existing data analytics workflows.  
  - Aiming to build **“Analyst Agents”** that can automatically answer questions about KPIs, trends, and reporting.  

- **Leveraging the AWS LIFT program:**  
  - Reviewing eligibility and applying to receive **AWS credits** for upcoming AI/Agentic AI R&D or PoC projects.  

- **Identifying internal use cases suitable for Agentic AI:**  
  - Reviewing workflows that involve many repetitive steps (reporting, monitoring, request classification, etc.) to see whether they can be transformed into AI agent workflows.  

- **Collaborating with partners such as Cloud Kinetics:**  
  - Instead of building everything 100% in-house, partnering with experts to design a robust architecture from the start, and avoid fundamental mistakes for complex systems.

### Event Experience

Attending the **“Exploring Agentic AI – Amazon QuickSuite”** workshop at Bitexco Financial Tower was a professional and multi-dimensional experience: combining theory, hands-on practice, and community connection.

#### Learning from experienced speakers

- I had the opportunity to hear directly from **AWS** and **Cloud Kinetics** about the vision for Agentic AI in enterprises.  
- The content was well balanced between **concepts** (what Agentic AI is and why it matters) and **real-world implementation** (how to use QuickSuite and where to start).  

#### Hands-on technical experience

- The **~90-minute hands-on session** allowed me to:  
  - Work directly with **QuickSight + QuickSuite Q**.  
  - Understand more concretely how an “analyst agent” can read data and answer business questions.  
- The “hands-on guidance” from AWS experts helped me quickly overcome initial difficulties when working with a new tool.  

#### Networking and ecosystem

- Networking time enabled me to talk with:  
  - Professionals working in cloud, data, and AI.  
  - The Cloud Kinetics team, which helped me better understand the role of partners in *turning* the AWS platform into concrete solutions for each industry.  

#### Key takeaways

- **Agentic AI is the future of enterprise operations:**  
  - The shift from “chatting with AI” to “AI actually doing the work” will unlock many new optimization models.  

- **Speed is a critical factor:**  
  - Tools like QuickSuite are designed for rapid deployment, so early adopters will gain a clear advantage in agility.  

- **Capital enables innovation:**  
  - The **AWS LIFT** program shows that the key question is no longer “Can we afford it?”, but rather “Do we have the courage and readiness to seize the opportunity?”.  

> In summary, the workshop helped me gain a much clearer understanding of **Agentic AI**, how AWS brings it to life through **Amazon QuickSuite**, and the resources (tools, partners, funding) that AWS provides so that businesses can start their AI adoption journey in a practical and sustainable way.
