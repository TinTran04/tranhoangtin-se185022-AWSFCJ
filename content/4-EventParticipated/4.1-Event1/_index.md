---

#### 4. Tracks 3 & 4: Data, AI and DevOps

- **Data Strategy:**  
  Experts from Onebyzero and Techcom Securities emphasized that **“data is the key differentiator”** for GenAI; AI output quality directly depends on input data quality.

- **The DevOps revolution:**  
  Katalon and Renova Cloud discussed integrating GenAI into the **DevOps lifecycle**: auto code generation, automated test creation, log analysis, and CI/CD optimization.

---

#### 5. Negative impacts of legacy application architectures

- Slow product release cycles → **Lost revenue and missed market opportunities**.  
- Inefficient operations → **Lost productivity and higher operational costs**.  
- Non-compliance with security standards → **High security risks and reputational damage**.

These limitations are the driving force behind **modernizing application architectures**.

---

#### 6. Transition to Microservices Architecture

The event emphasized the shift from monolithic systems to **Microservices Architecture**:

- Systems are modularized, with each function as an **independent service**.  
- Services communicate via **events** (event-driven).

Three key architectural pillars were highlighted:

- **Queue Management:** Handling asynchronous tasks, offloading the main system.  
- **Caching Strategy:** Optimizing performance and reducing query latency.  
- **Message Handling:** Enabling flexible communication between services, supporting scalability and fault tolerance.

---

#### 7. Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

- **Four-step approach:**  
  Identify **domain events** → build **timelines** → identify **actors** → define **bounded contexts**.

- **“Bookstore” case study:**  
  Used to demonstrate how to apply DDD in practice, from domain modeling to service decomposition.

- **Context mapping – 7 integration patterns:**  
  Helping manage relationships between bounded contexts (Partnership, Shared Kernel, Anti-corruption Layer, etc.).

---

#### 8. Event-Driven Architecture

- **Three main integration patterns:**  
  - Publish/Subscribe  
  - Point-to-Point  
  - Streaming  

- **Benefits:**  
  - **Loose coupling** between services  
  - Easy **scalability**  
  - Higher **resilience** in case of localized failures  

- **Sync vs Async comparison:**  
  Speakers clearly explained the **trade-offs**: synchronous calls are simpler but prone to bottlenecks; asynchronous patterns are more complex but more flexible and scalable.

---

#### 9. Compute Evolution & Serverless

- **Shared Responsibility Model:**  
  Explained the roles of AWS vs customers across compute models: **EC2 → ECS → Fargate → Lambda**.

- **Benefits of Serverless:**  
  - No server management  
  - Automatic scaling  
  - Pay-for-value based on actual usage  

- **Functions vs Containers:**  
  Suggested criteria for choosing between them (runtime duration, statefulness, frequency, deployment complexity, etc.).

---

#### 10. Amazon Q Developer

- **SDLC automation:**  
  Supporting developers across the entire lifecycle from **planning → coding → testing → maintenance**.

- **Code transformation:**  
  Helping upgrade Java, modernize .NET, and migrate from mainframe/legacy stacks to modern architectures.

- **AWS Transform Agents:**  
  Providing dedicated agents for VMware, Mainframe, .NET… to reduce time and risk during application modernization.

---

### Lessons Learned

#### 1. Design & Strategic Thinking

- **Business-first approach:**  
  Technology solutions must start from **business problems**, rather than following technology trends blindly.

- **Ubiquitous Language:**  
  A shared language between business and tech teams helps reduce misunderstandings and accelerates requirements analysis and design.

- **Resilience as a baseline:**  
  Modern systems need to be designed with **resilience** from the beginning, instead of patching after incidents occur.

---

#### 2. Technical Architecture

- **Event storming:**  
  An effective method to model business processes into **domain events**, leading naturally to DDD and event-driven architecture.

- **Event-driven communication:**  
  Replacing part of synchronous communication with event-driven mechanisms makes the system **more flexible, more scalable**, and less tightly coupled.

- **Integration patterns:**  
  Understanding clearly when to use synchronous APIs, when to use pub/sub, and when to use streaming (Kafka/Kinesis).

- **Compute spectrum:**  
  Knowing how to balance between VMs, containers, and serverless to choose the most suitable runtime for each workload.

---

#### 3. Modernization Strategy

- **Phased approach:**  
  Instead of “tearing everything down and rebuilding”, a phased roadmap is needed, prioritizing systems with the highest impact.

- **7Rs framework:**  
  There are multiple paths to modernization (Rehost, Replatform, Refactor, Rearchitect, Repurchase, Retire, Retain).  
  Each application must be assessed individually.

- **“Migrate to Operate”:**  
  The goal is not just to move to the cloud, but to **operate more intelligently after migration**, continuously optimizing cost, performance, and security.

- **ROI measurement:**  
  It is important to measure clearly: cost reduction, increased agility, shorter time-to-market, and improved customer experience.

---

### Application to My Work

- **Applying DDD to current projects:**  
  Organizing **event storming** sessions with the business team to model domains and split bounded contexts.

- **Refactoring Microservices:**  
  Using bounded contexts to define service boundaries, avoiding microservices being “over-fragmented” or overlapping responsibilities.

- **Implementing event-driven patterns:**  
  Gradually replacing certain synchronous APIs with asynchronous messaging, pub/sub, or streaming.

- **Serverless Adoption:**  
  Experimenting with some use cases on **AWS Lambda** or Fargate to evaluate real-world benefits.

- **Assessing data readiness:**  
  Before starting any GenAI project, checking data quality, data governance, and the overall data strategy.

- **Experimenting with GenAI in DevOps:**  
  Using tools like Amazon Q Developer to auto-generate code, tests, and shorten the development cycle.

- **Implementing “Security by design”:**  
  Applying best practices in IAM, encryption, logging, and monitoring right from the system design stage.

### Event Experience

Attending AWS Cloud Day Vietnam – AI Edition 2025 provided me with insights that are **both strategic and hands-on**:

#### Learning from high-profile experts

- Presentations from **banking leaders, cloud experts, and solution architects** helped me clearly see the connection between business strategy and technical infrastructure.  
- Real-world case studies (Techcombank, Honda, Masterise, TymeX…) gave me a concrete picture of the transformation journeys in different industries.

#### Practical technical experience

- Sessions on **event storming, DDD, microservices, and event-driven architecture** helped me connect theoretical knowledge with realistic deployment scenarios.  
- I was particularly impressed by the **“GenAI-powered App-DB Modernization”** workshop, which simulated the journey of modernizing a monolithic application into a cloud-native architecture.

#### Using modern tools

- My first deep dive into **Amazon Q Developer** in a real SDLC context showed me the potential of using AI to **increase developer productivity and reduce repetitive work**.  
- Integrating GenAI into DevOps gave me a new perspective on the future of software development.

#### Networking and discussions

- The event was a great opportunity to talk with experts and professionals working in finance, technology, and cloud consulting.  
- Through short side conversations, I realized that **digital transformation is not only about technology, but also about changing mindsets, ways of working, and organizational culture.**

#### Key takeaways

- **Data is the key differentiator:** GenAI cannot be truly effective if data is not properly governed.  
- **Modernization is a continuous journey:** There is no fixed “final destination”; it is an ongoing process of optimization and adaptation.  
- **Security is everyone’s responsibility:** From developers to operators, from leadership to staff, everyone must be conscious about security.
