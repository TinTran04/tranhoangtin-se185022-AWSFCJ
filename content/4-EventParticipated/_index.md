### [Event 1](4.1-Event1/)
&emsp;**Event name:** Vietnam Cloud Day 2025  

&emsp;**Date:** 18/09/2025  

&emsp;**Location:** 26th Floor, Bitexco Tower, 02 Hai Trieu Street, Ben Nghe Ward, District 1, Ho Chi Minh City  

&emsp;**Role in the event:** Attendee  

&emsp;**Brief description of main content and activities:**  
&emsp;Vietnam Cloud Day is an annual event organized by AWS, bringing together experts, enterprises, and the tech community to share the latest trends in cloud computing, AI, big data, and security.  
&emsp;The program includes strategic discussion sessions, industry-specific tracks (FSI, telecommunications, retail, real estate, etc.), technical sessions on modern architectures (microservices, event-driven, serverless), and real-world case study presentations from Techcombank, Honda, Masterise, TymeX, etc., providing a comprehensive view of the modernization journey on AWS.  

&emsp;**Outcomes / value gained (lessons learned, new skills, contributions to team/project):**  
&emsp;- Gained a clearer understanding of the role of Cloud & GenAI in the national digital transformation strategy and in key industries.  
&emsp;- Learned about modern architectural models such as DDD, microservices, event-driven, serverless, and how to choose appropriate compute services (EC2, ECS, Fargate, Lambda).  
&emsp;- Developed deeper awareness of the importance of data strategy, “security by design”, and the “migrate to operate” mindset instead of just “lift-and-shift”.  
&emsp;- Generated many ideas to apply to academic/personal projects (e.g., designing systems on AWS, integrating Amazon Q Developer into the DevOps workflow) and expanded my network with the cloud engineering community.  



### [Event 2](4.2-Event2/)
&emsp;**Event name:** GenAI-powered App-DB Modernization workshop  

&emsp;**Date:** 07/11/2025  

&emsp;**Location:** 26th Floor, Bitexco Tower, 02 Hai Trieu Street, Sai Gon Ward, Ho Chi Minh City  

&emsp;**Role in the event:** Attendee  

&emsp;**Brief description of main content and activities:**  
&emsp;The workshop focused on Agentic AI and the **Amazon QuickSuite** ecosystem, clarifying the difference between traditional Generative AI and Agentic AI that is capable of autonomous action.  
&emsp;Participants were introduced for the first time to QuickSuite in Vietnam, including the combination of **Amazon QuickSight** and **QuickSuite Q** to build “Analyst Agents” that can read data, answer business questions, and recommend appropriate actions.  
&emsp;The program also introduced the **AWS LIFT** financial support package (credits of up to USD 80,000) to reduce cost barriers when experimenting with AI/Agentic AI solutions.  
&emsp;A ~90-minute hands-on session allowed participants to work directly with QuickSight + QuickSuite Q under the guidance of AWS experts and Cloud Kinetics, and to network with the cloud, data, and AI community.  

&emsp;**Outcomes / value gained (lessons learned, new skills, contributions to team/project):**  
&emsp;- Gained a clearer understanding of **Agentic AI**, the shift from “AI that only answers” to “AI that actually works on behalf of humans”, and practical use cases in enterprises.  
&emsp;- Learned the main components of **Amazon QuickSuite**, and how to combine QuickSight and QuickSuite Q to build data analysis agents (analyst agents).  
&emsp;- Understood the role of the **AWS LIFT** program in financially supporting AI PoCs/R&D, enabling future proposals for related projects.  
&emsp;- Improved skills in designing Agentic AI use cases (selecting repetitive, multi-step, data-driven processes) and generated more ideas to apply to study/projects, such as automated reporting, metric monitoring, or operational optimization recommendations.
