## Next generation experiences took center stage

At devcom, AWS illustrated how game developers can build a scalable, browser-based game streaming platform that delivers AAA games in 1080p at 60 FPS using Amazon GameLift Streams. The demo combined this new capability with AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), and Amazon CloudFront. Attendees were able to see how the architecture enables secure, low-latency game streaming without requiring downloads, and can turn phones, tablets, and PCs into powerful gaming machines.  

AWS also showcased how to easily run any multiplayer game project on Amazon GameLift Servers using the new containers feature. Automating simple and fast packaging and deployment for projects with the Containers Starter Kit for Amazon GameLift, it results in faster iteration, without requiring the installation of local tools.  

AWS Partner demos included harnessing the power of AI-powered quality assurance solution Razer QA Co-AI to boost bug detection and highlighting how to support global releases without slowing down production with Phrase Platform for continuous game localization. By integrating directly with tools like Unity, Unreal Engine, GitHub, and more, it makes it easier for game developers to manage and automate translation across every content layerâ€”from UI to in-game dialogue. AWS also featured AI-powered game solutions from Globant, which streamline asset operations within existing pipelines across the gaming sector, and how devtodev by Appsflyer provides deep insights into a playerâ€™s journey.
