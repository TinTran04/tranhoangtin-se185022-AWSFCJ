## Solution Overview

Advanced digital technologies are revolutionizing the energy industry, enabling organizations to achieve sustainability goals while reducing costs and carbon emissions.  
According to McKinsey, digital transformation in the energy sector could unlock **$1.6 trillion in value** by 2035, helping reduce **20–30% of operational costs** and **5% of carbon emissions**.

As the industry moves towards a distributed power generation model integrated with renewable energy, businesses require smart solutions such as **digital grids, AI-driven energy coordination**, and **real-time monitoring platforms**.  

The **TCS Smart Power Plant solution** was developed to address these needs — delivering a 0.5% increase in performance, an 8% reduction in NOx, and improving 8–10% accuracy in renewable power generation forecasts.  
Built on the **AWS** platform, the solution leverages the power of **AI/ML** to process real-time data from thousands of energy sensors across multiple locations.

> *Figure 1. Overall architecture of the Smart Power Plant solution on AWS.*

- **Data Ingestion:** Data is collected from OPC-UA (industrial devices), on-premise historical systems, and Amazon S3 data lakes.  
  Each unit can send up to 4,000 sensor values per minute.  
- **Ingestion and Orchestration:** AWS IoT Core receives the data stream and triggers **AWS Step Functions** for automated orchestration.  
- **Data Processing:** **AWS Lambda functions** perform data cleaning, calculate KPIs, and generate alerts.  
- **Storage:** **Amazon DocumentDB** stores structured data (KPIs, alerts), **Amazon S3** stores raw sensor data and training results.  
- **ML Model Training:** Performed in **Amazon SageMaker**, with models stored in **Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)**.  
- **Real-Time Inference:** Models are deployed through **Amazon ECS** for TCS InTwin (online analytics engine).  
- **Application Deployment:** Front-end/back-end interfaces run containers on **Amazon ECS**, ensuring flexible scalability.
